Running MHD tests of PAMHD

Run test.exe by giving it both a general configuration file
and corresponding boundary configuration file from config_files
directory as command line arguments. The output will be written
to a directory specified in general configuration file. Use
mhd2gnuplot to plot results using gnuplot. For example:

./test.exe \
    --config-file config_files/shock_tube1_x_general.cfg \
    --boundary-file config_files/shock_tube1_x_boundaries.cfg

./mhd2gnuplot.exe results/shock_tube1_x/*.dc
